# ALQ-Computer-Laboratory-Monitoring-and-Controlling-Electrical-Appliances-Simulation-using-Raspberry
The main objective of the study is to design and develop a system “Computer Laboratory Monitoring and Controlling Electrical Appliances using Raspberry Pi with Fuzzy Logic”, the proponents proposed a study regarding the improvement of monitoring and controlling electrical appliances inside a computer laboratory. The system made by the proponents was a way to monitor and control the common electrical appliances inside a computer laboratory along with monitoring the load and usage of each appliance. The proponents conducted a brief interview and post-survey to gathered data to know if the devices used by the proponents can effective in terms of monitoring and controlling electrical appliances inside a computer laboratory.
